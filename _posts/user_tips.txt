Perhaps I've been frustrated recently because I've found myself getting really
irritated over simple things.  Yesterday I had an AFP share mounted read-only 
and I wanted to make an alias on my computer pointing to a folder on this 
share.  Normally I would right-click, choose Make Alias, copy the alias to my
computer, rename it so it doesn't say " alias" at the end, then go back and 
delete the original alias that was created.

I know that sounds ridiculous, but I don't actually make alaises that often so
it never really bothered me so much.  But since this drive was mounted read-only
creating an alias "in place" wasn't an option.  Ofcourse my next move was to
say "screw OS X", open up a Terminal and start typing `ln -s ...`, but then I 
decided there had to be a better way, perhaps some Terminal addon, or better yet
a replacement for Finder that maybe has tabs and bookmarks or all that stuff
that's been common for years in web browsers and makes perfect sense to include
in file browsers.  Someone must have thought of that, right?

Well, atleast regarding my original problem, the answer was yes, Finder does
that already.  Option + Command + Drag!

Then this morning I wanted to open a folder in a new Finder window.  So I right
click, expecting there to be an "Open in new window" option that for whatever
reason I never noticed before, because obviously I don't know OS X the way I
thought I did.  But it wasn't there.  But I refused to stop there, I found a way
yesterday and I'll do it again.  Sure enough Command + Double Click.

I feel a little embarrased that these simple shortcuts have elluded me for so
many years of using OS X and Finder everyday.  But whatever, I'm swallowing my
pride and sharing my new found knowledge via the Internet.
