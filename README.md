Raw desgin assets go in the design folder.

Web stuff goes in public.

Because this site changes so infrequently, I'm keeping the tech stack stupid simple.  No
pre-processors, no server-side scripting, no static site generators, just HTML/CSS/JS.

I am using <a href="//github.com/hakimel/reveal.js">reveal.js</a> for the edit reel slide show so
you'll need to download that bad boy and drop it in `public/lib/reveal.js`.
